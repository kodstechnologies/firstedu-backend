- Five sentences on a theme; **four form a coherent paragraph** — find the sentence that does not belong.
- Stem lists all five; options name the odd sentence (e.g. "Sentence 3", "C").

**4. Para Summary:**
- Short paragraph (80–150 words); choose the option that **best captures the central idea** — not a detail trap.

- Grammar correction, sentence improvement, error spotting, fill-in-the-blanks

Most chemistry defects are **correct math, wrong option text or wrong marked letter**.

- All four options must be **distinct** numeric values in the **same unit/scale** (all pH, all V, all mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹).
- pH options must be in **0–14** (e.g. 4.74, 5.04) — never bare integers like 74 or 44 for a buffer pH question.
- **Ratio / integer answers:** if the answer is a ratio (4:1) or bond order (2.5), every option must be a **different** ratio or value — never four copies of "1".

**Quantity type — do not confuse:**
- **E°cell** (volts, typically 0.1–3 V) ≠ random large integers (10 V is almost never correct).
- **Ka / Ksp** — match the calculated order of magnitude in one option.
- **Rate-law factor** (dimensionless) ≠ concentration units.
- **Molar conductivity** (S cm² mol⁻¹) — keep units consistent across options.
- **Nernst Ecell** — solve fully; last value in explanation must match the marked option in volts.

**Organic / nomenclature:**
- IUPAC names must be **fully distinct** across options (not two identical "hydroxybutanal").
- Use 1-/2-/3- prefixes to distinguish isomers (1-butene vs 2-butene).

**High-frequency chemistry traps (auto-rejected if violated):**
- **Mixing two solutions:** nᵢ = Mᵢ × Vᵢ (V in L); M_final = Σnᵢ / ΣVᵢ. If the solve is **0.32 M**, one option must read **0.32 M** — never leave **6 M** in the explanation while marking 0.32 M.
- **w/w % → molality:** on 100 g basis, molality = (mass solute / M) / (mass solvent in kg). All four options must use the same unit (**m**).
- **Buffer + strong acid/base:** update moles after neutralization, then Henderson–Hasselbalch; pH options **0–14** only.
- **Arrhenius at two temperatures:** compute k₂ from Ea, then integrated rate law for fractional conversion; **final time in seconds** must appear verbatim in one option — not an intermediate k or ln value.

**Discipline before JSON:**
1. Solve with given data → one final value with correct unit.
2. Write four **distinct** plausible distractors; place the solved value verbatim in exactly one.
3. Set correctAnswer to that letter; explanation derives the **same** final value (max 3 sentences, no "wait"/"re-evaluating").
4. Do not embed any option text in the question stem.

**If options would duplicate, use wrong notation, or math ≠ any option → discard and pick a simpler problem.**`;

- Do not mix scales across options (e.g. 1.66 eV next to 6575 eV) unless the stem explicitly uses both.
- **Ideal gas / total pressure:** if the solve is 4.926 atm, one option must read **4.93 atm** or **4.926 atm** — never drop the decimal (926 atm is wrong).
- **Ratio questions (Bohr orbits, etc.):** options must be distinct ratios (1:2, 2:1, 4:1) — never four identical integers.
- eV, keV, MeV, J — convert once, solve once, write the option in the unit the question asks for.
- Wavelength options: all in nm, or all in Å, or all in m — never mixed.

- **Equivalent resistance / capacitance** vs **branch current / voltage** — mark what was asked.

**Multi-step mechanics, optics, modern physics:**
- Non-uniform circular motion: find a_t and a_c separately, then a = √(a_t² + a_c²); the option must be this resultant with correct units.
- Photoelectric effect: E_photon and Φ in eV → KE_max in eV (typical 0–10 eV range, not thousands).
- Lens/mirror: finish by answering exactly what the stem requests (f, v, u, magnification, or power).

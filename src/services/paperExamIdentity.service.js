- Prefer **direct / single-idea** stems. Pattern recognition + computational speed are OK.
- **Banned for JEE Main (these are Advanced — do NOT write them):**
  - Coupled multi-equilibrium / simultaneous constraint puzzles (mass+charge balance as the core ask).
  - Multi-domain fusion (e.g. probability + positive-definite matrices; orbital energy + eccentricity + angular-momentum chain).
  - Non-routine “first principles” insight puzzles that need 2–3 major techniques fused.
- Allowed Main hardness: non-obvious setup **inside ONE chapter** (e.g. Ksp OR Ka separately; circular-orbit speed/energy one-hop; one counting inequality).

**Planning rules:**
1. **${n} unique slots** — different micro-topic, setup, and solving chain; no near-duplicate templates.
2. **Match the composition above + full coverage:** assign each slot's \`questionKind\` so the batch mix reflects a real ${examLabel} paper (see composition block). Spread \`multi_concept\`, \`direct\`, and \`theory\` across **different syllabus units** so all major topic areas get a slot when batch size allows.
3. **Syllabus breadth** — spread across major ${subjectLabel} areas appropriate to the topic and exam (do not cluster on one unit), and only within the in-scope topics from Step 0.
4. **Depth per kind:** \`multi_concept\` = ≥2 linked concepts (state fusion in \`conceptFusion\`), ≥3 solve steps, no single-formula plug-in. \`direct\` = ONE clean formula/concept, ~1–2 steps (single-formula is correct — do NOT force fusion). \`theory\` = conceptual depth + close distractors, no computation.
5. **conceptFusion** = the fused ideas for a \`multi_concept\` slot (e.g. "rotation + friction"); optional for \`direct\`/\`theory\`.
6. **conceptSlot** = short snake_case id you invent (e.g. \`rolling_threshold_mu\`, \`ohms_law_direct\`).
7. **pattern** = what problem shape to write (1–2 sentences), matching the slot's kind.
8. **required** = mandatory stem/solve constraints for that kind (1–2 sentences).
9. **banned** = templates to reject (1 sentence).
10. **stemHint** = one example stem shape — writer must create a NEW problem, not copy verbatim.
